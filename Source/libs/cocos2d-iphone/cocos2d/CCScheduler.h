/** CCScheduler is responsible of triggering the scheduled callbacks.
 You should not use NSTimer. Instead use this class.

 There are 2 different types of callbacks (selectors):

	- update selector: the 'update' selector will be called every frame. You can customize the priority.
	- custom selector: A custom selector will be called every frame, or with a custom interval of time

 The 'custom selectors' should be avoided when possible. It is faster, and consumes less memory to use the 'update selector'.

 You can use this property to create a 'slow motion' or 'fast forward' effect.

 The difference between `pauseAllTargets` and `pause, is that `setPaused` will pause the CCScheduler,
 while `pauseAllTargets` will pause all the targets, one by one.
 `setPaused` will pause the whole Scheduler, meaning that calls to `resumeTargets:`, `resumeTarget:` won't affect it.
